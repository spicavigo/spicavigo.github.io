                <h1>Trivial Compute - Question Creation Guide</h1>
                <p>Administrators have access to the dashboard where they're able to create question categories, create multiple-choice questions, and input answer choices.</p>

                <h2>Categories</h2>
                <p>Start out by customizing the categories. Common categories have already been entered into the application, like History, Math, and Entertainment. Each question needs to be associated with a category for it to be presented during the game.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Creating a new category:</strong> Enter the category name into the textbox at the top of the "Categories" section.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deleting a category: </strong> Click the trash icon on the right of a given category to delete it. Associated questions will not be deleted; instead they will need to be reassigned to a new category.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Questions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Creating a question: </strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The "Create New Qustion" form is at the bottom of the page. Quickly access it by clicking the "Add Question" link on the left navbar.</li>
                            <li>Using the editor textbox, enter your question and insert any media like images, audio, or video. Additionally, you can add style your questions with headers, bold, strikethrough, and so on.</li>
                            <li>Select an existing category from the dropdown menu.</li>
                            <li>Input the the correct answer as well as wrong answers. Note that choices are presented to the uesr in the order that they are input here, so variety should be used for the order of the correct answer. It's recommended to have 4 total choices.</li>
                            <li>Select the correct answer from the dropdown.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Deleting a question: </strong>Click the trash icon above the question prompt.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Number of answers: </strong> It's recommended that questions have 4 choices. Generally Trivial Compute is meant to be a fast-paced game where the answer is chosen quickly, which is helped by limiting the number of choices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Number of questions: </strong> This will depend on the length of the game and the number of players. Multiple rounds are often played, so having many questions for a given category will increase variety.</li>
