                <h1>Trivial Compute - Player User Guide</h1>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Trivial Compute, a fun and educational computer game based on the classic Trivial Pursuit!
                    In this
                    game, you'll test your knowledge and learn new facts while answering questions in different
                    categories. The goal
                    is to collect tokens by answering questions correctly and be the first player to complete your token
                    collection.
                </p>

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Opening the Game</strong>: To start the game, navigate to the Trivial Compute URL in
                        your browser
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Selecting Players</strong>: The game can be played by 1 to 4 players. Each player will
                        be
                        automatically assigned a unique color dot as their token. Enter your name to join the game.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choosing Categories</strong>: Before the game starts, players will collectively choose
                        four
                        categories of questions from a list. The selected categories will form the basis of the
                        questions you'll be
                        answering during the game.</li>
                    <li><strong>Understanding the Board</strong>: The game board is arranged in a square, with nine
                        squares on each
                        side. Each side has a "category headquarters" square, and spokes emanate from the center square.
                        Additionally, the four corner squares are "Roll Again" squares, which allow you to roll the dice
                        again if
                        your token lands on them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scoring</strong>: The game board has spaces with different colors, representing
                        different
                        categories. Answering a question correctly in a category headquarters square earns you a token
                        of that
                        color. The player who collects all four tokens of different colors first wins the game.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Rolling the Dice</strong>: The player who starts the game will roll the dice first.
                        Click on the
                        dice icon to roll. The number rolled will determine the number of spaces your token can move.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Choosing a Destination</strong>: After rolling the dice, valid destination squares will
                        start
                        pulsating. Click on one of the pulsating squares to move your token there. Your token will be
                        automatically
                        moved to the selected square.</li>
                    <li><strong>Answering Questions</strong>: When your token lands on a square, a question will be
                        displayed in a
                        window on the screen. Read the question carefully and choose an option that you believe is
                        correct. Click
                        the "Submit" button to submit your answer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Revealing the Correct Answer</strong>: After submitting your answer, the correct answer
                        will be
                        shown in the same dialog. If you answered correctly, you get to roll the dice again. If not,
                        your turn ends, and the next player takes their turn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Navigating the Board</strong>: The center square has special rules. You, as the player,
                        will choose
                        the category for the question from a dialog shown to you. If you land on a category headquarters
                        square, you
                        must answer a question from that category.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winning the Game</strong>: Keep moving along the board, answering questions, and
                        collecting tokens.
                        The first player to collect all four tokens of different colors and return to the center square
                        wins the
                        game!</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Tips and Strategies</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Choose Your Categories Wisely</strong>: During the initial setup, discuss with your
                        opponents which
                        categories you are comfortable with and select them as your playing categories.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pay Attention to Opponents' Progress</strong>: Keep an eye on your opponents' token
                        collections and
                        try to block them from getting their last token.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Category Headquarters Strategically</strong>: Plan your moves to land on a category
                        headquarters
                        square and answer questions correctly to collect more tokens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Utilize "Roll Again" Squares</strong>: Landing on a "Roll Again" square provides an
                        advantage. Use
                        it strategically to move farther along the board.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay Calm and Focused</strong>: Some questions might be challenging, but don't panic.
                        Stay focused
                        and think through the options before submitting your answer.</li>
                </ul>
